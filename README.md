## Abstract

Human mobility significantly influences the geographic spread of infectious diseases. This study addresses critical questions:

1. How does mobility contribute to infection spread within the United States at local, regional, and national scales?
2. How do seasonality and behavioral shifts affect mobility over time?
3. At what geographic level is mobility homogeneous across the United States?

Understanding these aspects is essential for developing accurate transmission models, predicting disease propagation across scales, and determining optimal geographic and temporal scales for implementing control policies. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
